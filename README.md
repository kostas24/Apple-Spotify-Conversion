# Apple-Spotify-Conversion

#Purpose/Idea:
When a friend who uses Spotify music messages you a song to listen to, and you have Apple Music, you're unable to listen to 
that song without manually going and searching it up. This code is helps solve that problem by simply copying the link 
(either spotify link or apple music link) and it will redirect you to the opposing platform. 

##Current Status:
As of right now, I have the basic conversion from Apple to Spotify, however it is not complete and not optimized. It's 
a prototype. I'm working on completing this partand then moving to the Spotify to Apple music converter. This only works
on laptop/computer at the moment and not smartphones.


###How to Use:
Simply paste an Apple Music link or Spotify link into the JFrame popup and press enter. The rest will happen on its own. 
  https://     Must be included in the URL. 
  

####What is Being Used:
The program was created in Java using the JSoup JavaLibrary and JFrame.
